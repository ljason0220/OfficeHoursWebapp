### Goal/Strategy:
- We hope our diverse set of experience and learning goals will be a good fit.
- We will have groups of individuals focusing on the web client, and the database, with everyone contributing to the end points but it is not concrete and anyone can help others working on a different area.
- We plan on following the branching strategy at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=vsts. Each member will create a new branch for the current feature they are working on. Once the feature is completed, that member will issue a pull request. Another member from the same team(front-end/back-end) will review the code and merge to master branch.
- We will be using the GitHub Kanban board & Issues tabs to keep track of work that needs to be done and individual assignments.
- Using Microsoft strategy, we will have a meeting at the beginning of each iteration and identify 10 to 15 features we want to work on. Each member will pick 2 to 3 features and add it to the Kanban board under in progress. The members would work on those features until completion and move them under finished. During the iteration, members may discover new features/major bugs that needs to be addressed. Those tasks will be added under To Do and they will be addressed in the next iteration. However, members can create new tasks and work on them at anytime as long as their assigned features are also being worked on.Furthermore if a feature identified at the beginning of the iteration is too big for one iteration, the member assigned would break the feature into smaller features and add the ones they can't complete to the To Do section.
### Roles:

- Gordon:Front-end, in charge of Travis, will review Brandon's pull requests
