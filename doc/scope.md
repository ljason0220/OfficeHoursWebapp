Our team learning goal is to create a responsive and user friendly web application and an efficient and robust server and database. We were able to reach this goal as a result of combining our individual goals of:
- Gordon -> Gaining front end experience (w/ React)
- Brandon -> More front end experience, learn more about making user friendly webapps
- Jason -> Learning Backend, setting up API endpoints
- Daewoo -> Solidfying knowledge in back end development (in MongoDB)
- Adnan -> Improving back end skills (increasing MongoDB knowledge)

Additionally, it allows us to become more comfortable in better learning technologies (i.e. React, Mongo) which are used widely in the job market.

Given our individual and team goals, we decided on implementing the following use cases:

For the instructor
- Manage preferences (e.g. reminder schedule, default calendar view)
- Create new classes
- Import classlist (csv file from CDF or quercus)
- Create/Delete office hour intervals (One time & Repeating)
- Manage/Reschedule/Cancel/Delete meetings
- Generate persistent link to share meetings and/or intervals
- Sync/Export intervals and meetings to personal electronic calendar(s)
	
For the student
- Manage preferences (e.g. reminder schedule, default calendar view)
- Choose/Edit/Cancel meeting slot
- Sync/Export meetings to personal electronic calendar(s)

In particular, we are omitting (for the time being), functionality pertaining to writing notes & comments for the student & teacher. These use cases will best allow our team to accomplish our individual and team goals.
